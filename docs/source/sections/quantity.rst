Quantities
==========

Density
-------
Number of agent per unit of area :math:`\rho` of unit :math:`\mathrm{P / m^{2}}`. Realistic values range from :math:`0` to :math:`10` people per square metre. Density ranges can be classified in increasing order

- Free flow :math:`\rho \in [0,  1]`
- Stable :math:`\rho \in [1,  2.5]`
- Capacity :math:`\rho \in [2.5,  3.5]`
- Unstable :math:`\rho \in [3.5,  5]`
- Congested :math:`\rho \geq 5`

Another way to define density in unit-less quantity is to define it to be the percentage of area occupied. This has value range :math:`0` to :math:`1`.

Flow
----
Crowd flow has similarities with granular flow, gas kinetics and fluid-dynamics.

Rate
^^^^
Number of agents per second :math:`Q` of unit :math:`\mathrm{1 / s}`.

Types
^^^^^
- Uni-directional
- Bi-directional
- Multi-directional
- Orthogonal


Pressure
--------
Crowd pressure :math:`p` created by contact forces when multiple agents press onto each others.
