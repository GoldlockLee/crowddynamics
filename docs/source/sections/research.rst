**Social force model for pedestrian dynamics (1995)**

Introduces the concept of *social force model* for pedestrian dynamics.

    *The social force is not exerted by the environment on a pedestrian’s body. It is rather a quantity that describes the concrete motivation to act.*

    *Pedestrian models can provide valuable tools for designing and planning pedestrian areas, subway or railroad stations, big buildings, shopping malls*


**Simulating Dynamical Features of Escape Panic (2000)**

Popularization of the use of social force model for crowd dynamics.

Uses of social force model for modelling room evacuation process. Well formulated social force model. Highly cited paper and equations used here serves as a base for simulation models using social force for crowd dynamics. This model is improved and new features are added in later papers.

* Base equation for calculating total force in social force model (not in this exact form in the paper).

  .. math::
      \mathbf{f}_{i}(t) = \mathbf{f}_{i}^{adj} + \sum_{j\neq i}^{} \left(\mathbf{f}_{ij}^{soc} + \mathbf{f}_{ij}^{c}\right) + \sum_{w}^{} \left(\mathbf{f}_{iw}^{soc} + \mathbf{f}_{iw}^{c}\right)

  Formulation of individual forces is improved in later papers.

* Summarizes some characteristic features of escape panic
   1) People move or try to move considerably faster than normal.
   2) Individuals start pushing, and interactions among people become physical in nature.
   3) Moving and, in particular, passing of a bottleneck becomes incoordinated.
   4) At exits, arching and clogging are observed.
   5) Jams are building up.
   6) The physical interactions in the jammed crowd add up and cause dangerous pressures up to :math:`4450` Newtons per meter, which can bend steel barriers or tear down brick walls.
   7) Escape is further slowed down by fallen or injured people turning into “obstacles”.
   8) People show a tendency of mass behaviour, i.e., to do what other people do.
   9) Alternative exits are often overlooked or not efficiently used in escape situations.

**Simulation of Pedestrian Crowds in Normal and Evacuation Situations (2002)**

Quote on chapter *Analogies with gases, fluids, and granular media*

   When the density is low, pedestrians can move freely, and crowd dynamics can be compared with the behavior of gases. At medium and high densities, the motion of pedestrian crowds shows some striking analogies with the motion of fluids and granular flow

   1) Footprints of pedestrians in snow look similar to streamlines of fluids.
   2) At borderlines between opposite directions of walking one can observe *viscous fingering*.
   3) The emergence of pedestrian streams through standing crowds appears analogous to the formation of river beds.
   4) Similar to segregation or stratification phenomena in granular media, pedestrians spontaneously organize in lanes of uniform walking direction, if the pedestrian density is high enough.
   5) At bottlenecks (e.g. corridors, staircases, or doors), the passing direction of pedestrians oscillates. This may be compared to the “saline oscillator” or the granular “ticking hour glass”.
   6) One can find the propagation of shock waves in dense pedestrian crowds pushing forward.
   7) The arching and clogging in panicking crowds is similar to the outflow of rough granular media through small openings.

Freezing by heat is investigated.


**Crowd dynamics discrete element multi-circle model (2006)**

Introduces *multi-circle model* aka *three circle model* for the shape of the agent instead of circular model. Translational motion and forces are based on the social force model. Rotational motion is introduced and formulated. Also contains table of values used in the simulation.

* Improved agent model

**Morphological and dynamical aspects of the room evacuation process (2007)**

**Modelling subgroup behaviour in crowd dynamics DEM simulation (2009)**

Addresses importance of subgroup modelling, because crowd often do not consist only of pure individual but subgroup e.q friends or families that prefer to stay together.

* Subgroup model, which can model agents that stay together.
* Adds physical damping force to contact force.

Model is validated by comparing simulations to real world data.
