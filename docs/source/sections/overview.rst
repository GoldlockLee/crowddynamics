*Multi agent system (MAS)*

   Computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents within an environment. *Wikipedia*

*Passive agent*

   Obstable like a wall.

*Active agent*

   Individual human pedestrian that is subject to motion.

*Crowd*

   A crowd is large group of individuals :math:`N \geq 100 \,\mathrm{P}` within the same space at the same time whose movements are for a prolonged period of time :math:`t \geq 60 \,\mathrm{s}` dependent on predominantly local interactions :math:`\rho \geq 1 \,\mathrm{P/m^{2}}`. [1]


*Social force model*

   It is suggested that the motion of pedestrians can be described as if they would be subject to *social forces*. These *forces* are not directly exerted by the pedestriansâ€™ personal environment, but they are a measure for the internal motivations of the individuals to perform certain actions (movements). [2]

*Egress congestion*

   Jamming that happens when multiple agent try to exit through same bottleneck.

*Crowd density*

    :math:`\rho`

*Crowd pressure*

*Counterflow model*

*Uni-directional flow*

*Bi-directional/parallel flows*

*Multi-directional flow*

*Orthogonal/crossing flows*
