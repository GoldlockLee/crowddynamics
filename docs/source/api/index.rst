.. Source code and Python requirements information.

Source is written using python version 3.4. Code uses *Numpy* for efficient numerical arrays and *Numba* to just-in-time compile Python functions into computationally efficient machine code. This keeps the source code readable and easily understandable.

The aim is to keep the code highly modular and extendable so that new crowd dynamical models can be easily integrated and tested.

Graphical user interface using *PyQt4* and *pyqtgraph* for interactive visualization of the simulation.
