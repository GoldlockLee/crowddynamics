Definition of crowd dynamics

.. epigraph::

   Crowd Dynamics can be defined as the study of the how and where crowds form and move above the critical density of more than one person per square metre. At high density there is the potential for overcrowding and personal injury.

   -- *Prof. Dr. G. Keith Still*

Crowd simulations are a based on group dynamics and crowd psychology.

Crowd simulations can be used as a tool for venue design to improve crowd flows and to prevent disasters and stampedes. Algorithms for producing movement can also be used for game and animation technology to produce more realistic looking movement.
