.. TODO: Embed youtube video to demonstrate the concept

Motivation
----------
.. Section of talking why crowd simulation model should be developed and where they can be applied to.


Crowd Research
--------------

- Crowd
- Crowd Dynamics

*Crowd dynamics* studies movement of human crowds.
.. Crowd dynamics, psychology, simulation and analysis

Definition of crowd dynamics

.. epigraph::

   Crowd Dynamics can be defined as the study of the how and where crowds form and move above the critical density of more than one person per square metre. At high density there is the potential for overcrowding and personal injury.

   -- *Prof. Dr. G. Keith Still*

Crowd simulations are a based on group dynamics and crowd psychology.



Applications
------------

Real life applications for crowd research and crowd dynamics are

* Improving safety of buildings, mass events and crowded places in general.
* Evacuation time estimation and understanding evacuation processes
* Venue design and improving the flow rates of the crowd in critical parts. For example busy subways.
* Producing realistic movement in games, animations and virtual reality
