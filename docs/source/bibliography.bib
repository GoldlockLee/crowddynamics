abstract = {The four-arc approximation to ellipses is important for such applications as image processing, curve fitting, NC machining, cam design, and collision avoidance. As approximation quality is evaluated in engineering usually by the maximum error, this paper aims to minimize the maximum error, starting from an analysis of the traditional method, by which, in a quarter of an ellipse, the maximum errors of the four arcs appear at two points: one at the small circular arc (positive error), the other at the large arc (negative error), but the latter's absolute value is quite less than the former. Since on the condition for tangent continuity one of the four-arc parameters (e.g., p) is free, we can adjust the parameter to reduce the former error with a trade-off of increasing the latter's absolute value, so as to improve the overall accuracy of the approximation. An analytical function of the optimal p/a versus b/a in implicit form, and furthermore in explicit form with negligible error, are obtained.},

@article{Langston2006,
abstract = {A Discrete Element Method (DEM) technique for modelling crowd dynamics is developed. Each person is represented by three overlapping circles with a position, orientation and velocity in 2D. Contact forces between elements are modelled as well as psychological forces and motive forces and moments. Motion is then modelled in a Newtonian manner with a numerical integration time-stepping scheme. The model is tested on a single enclosure entry scenario where some model parameters are scaled. Motion is generally realistic, although areas for improvement are identified. Flow and contact forces are monitored under different scenarios. The model is then used on a multi-enclosure entry scenario. It is shown that stewarding significantly reduces contact forces and hence risk of injury. The potential for further applications is demonstrated on hypothetical scenarios on the London Underground. It is concluded that the model is reasonably realistic for dense crowd flow scenarios, but more complex situations like a supermarket would require aspects of Artificial Intelligence in the model, which is a feasible development. The three-circle representation gives a reasonable model of the 2D geometry. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Seyfried2007a,
abstract = {Capacity estimation is an important tool for the design and dimensioning of pedestrian facilities. The literature contains different procedures and specifications which show considerable differences with respect to the estimated flow values. Moreover do new experimental data indicate a stepwise growing of the capacity with the width and thus challenge the validity of the specific flow concept. To resolve these differences we have studied experimentally the unidirectional pedestrian flow through bottlenecks under laboratory conditions. The time development of quantities like individual velocities, density and individual time gaps in bottlenecks of different width is presented. The data show a linear growth of the flow with the width. The comparison of the results with experimental data of other authors indicates that the basic assumption of the capacity estimation for bottlenecks has to be revised. In contradiction with most planning guidelines our main result is, that a jam occurs even if the incoming flow does not overstep the capacity defined by the maximum of the flow according to the fundamental diagram.},

@article{Cristiani2015b,
abstract = {In this paper we are concerned with the simulation of crowds in built environments, where obstacles play a role in the dynamics and in the interactions among pedestrians. First of all, we review the state-of-the-art of the techniques for handling obstacles in numerical simulations. Then, we introduce a new modelling technique which guarantees both impermeability and opacity of the obstacles, and does not require ad hoc runtime interventions to avoid collisions. Most important, we solve a complex optimization problem by means of the Particle Swarm Optimization method in order to exploit the so-called Braess's paradox. More precisely, we reduce the evacuation time from a room by adding in the walking area multiple obstacles optimally placed and shaped.},

@techreport{Hess2013,
abstract = {This whitepaper provides an introduction to Agile programming using PyQt—the Python bindings for the Qt{\textregistered} application development framework. The whitepaper briefly makes the case for the Agile programming approach and for the use of the very high level dynamic language, Python. It also presents some of the key benefits available from the Qt application development framework and shows how the combination of Qt and Python—PyQt, provides an ideal combination for rapidly creating powerful and flexible GUI applications. PyQt applications can run on any platform that has PyQt, Python, and the Qt libraries installed, simply by copying the application—and with no source code changes necessary. (It is also possible to create stand-alone executables.) The currently supported platforms include all versions of Windows fromWindows 98 toVista,and most Unixesand Unix clones that run X11, including Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris, and HP-UX. Using PyQt, developers can write applications with native look and feel on all these platforms, without having to waste their time on ironing out platform differences or filling in gaps, since all these details are handled automatically by PyQt.},

@article{Heliovaara2013,
abstract = {Large crowds evacuating through narrow bottlenecks may create clogging and jams that slow down the egress flow. Especially if people try to push towards the exit, the so-called faster-is-slower effect may occur. We propose a spatial game to model the interaction of agents in such situations. Each agent has two possible modes of play that lead to either patient or impatient behavior. The payoffs of the game are derived from simple assumptions and correspond to a hawk-dove game, where the game parameters depend on the agent's location in the crowd and on external conditions. Equilibrium configurations are computed with a myopic best-response rule and studied in both a continuous space and a discrete lattice. We apply the game model to a continuous-time egress simulation, where the patient and impatient agents are given different individual parameter values, which are updated according to the local conditions in the crowd. The model shows how threatening conditions can increase the proportion of impatient agents, which leads to clogging and reduced flows through bottlenecks, even when smooth flows would be possible.},

@inproceedings{VonSchantz2014,
abstract = {For numerical simulations of crowd dynamics in an evacuation we need a computationally light environment, such as the cellular automaton model (CA). By choosing the right model parameters, different types of crowd behavior and collective effects can be produced. But the CA does not answer why, when, and how these different behaviors and collective effects occur. In this article, we present a model, where we couple a spatial evacuation game to the CA. In the game, an agent chooses its strategy by observing its neighbors' strategies. The game matrix changes with the distance to the exit as the evacuation conditions develop. In the resulting model, an agent's strategy choice alters the parameters that govern its behavior in the CA. Thus, with our model, we are able to simulate how evacuation conditions affect the behavior of the crowd. Also, we show that some of the collective effects observed in evacuations are a result of the simple game the agents play.},
