abstract = {In this article, a recently presented evacuation modelling programme is developed further. Its major fea- tures are described and first verification and validation results are shown. The evacuation programme allows the modelling of high crowd density situations and the interaction between evacuation simula- tions and state-of-the-art fire simulations. Persons are treated as autonomous agents and some social interactions among the agents are introduced in the model. A reaction function model is used to select the exit routes. The size of each person is represented by three circles approximating the shape of the human body. Persons experience contact forces and moments as well as psychological and motive forces and moments. The resulting equations of motions for the translational and rotational degrees of freedom are solved using the methods of dissipative particle dynamics on 2D planes representing the floors of a building. The computational tool for evacuation modelling is implemented as a part of the FireDynamics Simulator (FDS). Like the current version of FDS, the evacuation module, FDS+Evac, presented in this article is made publicly and freely available. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {In this study, a microscopic simulation model is developed for pedestrian behavior analysis at signalized crosswalks. It takes into account the special characteristics of pedestrian crossing behavior, such as group evasion with surrounding pedestrians, collision avoidance with conflicting vehicles, response to signal control, and response to crosswalk boundary. The classical social force model is modified to reproduce repulsive and attractive phenomena. Furthermore, a generic calibration approach is proposed based on maximum log-likelihood estimation, which enables to identify significant parameters in a statistical way. Last, a rigorous validation is conducted to confirm the model performance in terms of collision avoidance behavior with conflicting pedestrians and vehicles.},

abstract = {It is suggested that the motion of pedestrians can be described as if they would be subject to `social forces'. These `forces' are not directly exerted by the pedestrians' personal environment, but they are a measure for the internal motivations of the individuals to perform certain actions (movements). The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can be also applied to the description of other behaviors.   In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: First, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion. Second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance to other pedestrians and borders. Third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion are nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically.},

abstract = {One of the most disastrous forms of collective human behaviour is the kind of crowd stampede induced by panic, often leading to fatalities as people are crushed or trampled. Sometimes this behaviour is triggered in life-threatening situations such as fires in crowded buildings; at other times, stampedes can arise during the rush for seats or seemingly without cause. Although engineers are finding ways to alleviate the scale of such disasters, their frequency seems to be increasing with the number and size of mass events. But systematic studies of panic behaviour and quantitative theories capable of predicting such crowd dynamics are rare. Here we use a model of pedestrian behaviour to investigate the mechanisms of (and preconditions for) panic and jamming by uncoordinated motion in crowds. Our simulations suggest practical ways to prevent dangerous crowd pressures. Moreover, we find an optimal strategy for escape from a smoke-filled room, involving a mixture of individualistic behaviour and collective 'herding' instinct.},

abstract = {The most important objective of a fire safety design is to ensure that humans can safely escape from a building in the case of fire. Fire regulations are adequate for normal buildings but may not take into account the special issues of large and complicated buildings, like shopping centres, assembly facilities, etc. Numerical simulation of fire and evacuation processes can be used to improve fire safety in such buildings. However, the usability of many current evacuation models is limited, because they do not take into account the individual properties and decision making processes of humans, the dynamics of large crowds and the interaction between fire and people. In this article, a recently presented evacuation programme is developed further. The code allows the modelling of 'panic' situations and the interaction between evacuation simulation and the state-of-the-art fire simulation. The major features of the human movement algorithm are described. A reaction function model for exit route selection and some social interactions among agents are introduced into the computer programme.

abstract = {When a large group of pedestrians is to be evacuated out of a building, one of the most dangerous locations is at the doors. In emergency situations when pedestrians panic or fear for their lives, they tend to force their ways out, even if the exits are jammed, which creates a clogging phenomenon that is much more pronounced during an evacuation than under normal conditions. It has been shown that it is possible to increase the outfl ow by suitably placing a pillar or some other type of obstacle in front of the exit, which reduces the inter-pedestrian pressure in front of the door, decreases the magnitude of clogging and therefore makes the overall outfl ow higher and more regular. To investigate how the architectural infrastructure in the vicinity of a door, or other bottleneck, shall be construc- ted to maximize the pedestrian outfl ow under evacuation conditions, we present a method based on a Genetic Algorithm.},

abstract = {Force-based models describe pedestrian dynamics in analogy to classical mechanics by a system of second order ordinary differential equations. By investigating the linear stability of two main classes of forces, parameter regions with unstable homogeneous states are identified. In this unstable regime it is then checked whether phase transitions or stop-and-go waves occur. Results based on numerical simulations show, however, that the investigated models lead to unrealistic behavior in form of backwards moving pedestrians and overlapping. This is one reason why stop-and-go waves have not been observed in these models. The unrealistic behavior is not related to the numerical treatment of the dynamic equations but rather indicates an intrinsic problem of this model class. Identifying the underlying generic problems gives indications how to define models that do not show such unrealistic behavior. As an example we introduce a new force-based model which produces realistic jam dynamics without the appearance of unrealistic negative speeds for empirical desired walking speeds.},

abstract = {When agents in a multi-robot system move, they need to adapt their paths to account for potential collisions with other agents and with static obstacles. Existing distributed navigation methods compute motions that are optimal lo-cally but do not account for the aggregate motions of all the agents. When there are many agents that move in a crowded space, the result is an inefficient global behavior. To address this issue, we propose a new approach which leverages tech-niques from machine learning and game theory. Agents us-ing our approach dynamically adapt their motion depending on local conditions in their current environment. We vali-date our approach experimentally in a variety of scenarios and with different numbers of agents. When compared to other machine learning techniques, our approach produces motions that are more efficient and make better use of the space, allowing agents to reach their destinations faster.},

In order to handle large crowds, some scalable architectures have been proposed. Nevertheless, the effective use of distributed systems requires the use of partitioning methods that can properly distribute the workload generated by agents among the existing distributed resources. In this paper, we analyze the use of irregular shape regions (convex hulls) for solving the partitioning problem. We have compared a partitioning method based on convex hulls with two techniques that use rectangular regions. The performance evaluation results show that the convex hull method outperforms the rest of the considered methods in terms of both fitness function values and execution times, regardless of the movement pattern followed by the agents. These results show that the shape of the regions in the partition can improve the performance of the partitioning method, rather than the heuristic method used. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As an example, we demonstrate its application using the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance method introduced in robotics. Preliminary results show that, using our adaptive approach, the agents exhibit a more polite and respectful behavior toward each other, as compared to approaches that do not use learning.

abstract = {Human crowds often bear a striking resemblance to interacting particle systems, and this has prompted many researchers to describe pedestrian dynamics in terms of interaction forces and potential energies. The correct quantitative form of this interaction, however, has remained an open question. Here, we introduce a novel statistical-mechanical approach to directly measure the interaction energy between pedestrians. This analysis, when applied to a large collection of human motion data, reveals a simple power-law interaction that is based not on the physical separation between pedestrians but on their projected time to a potential future collision, and is therefore fundamentally anticipatory in nature. Remarkably, this simple law is able to describe human interactions across a wide variety of situations, speeds, and densities. We further show, through simulations, that the interaction law we identify is sufficient to reproduce many known crowd phenomena.},

Each person is represented as three overlapping circles and motion is modelled in a Newtonian manner. It incorporates psychological forces as well as physical forces in a 2D time-stepping environment. The DEM model was modified to include realistic subgroup behaviour, representing people in the crowd desiring to stay together (families, friends, etc.). Subgroup psychological forces were incorporated.

Usually models of pedestrian dynamics are (implicitly) built on the assumption that pedestrians walk along the shortest path. Model elements formulated to make pedestrians locally avoid collisions and intrusion into personal space do not produce motion on quickest paths. Therefore a special model element is needed, if one wants to model and simulate pedestrians for whom travel time matters most (e.g. travelers in a station hall who are late for a train). Here such a model element is proposed, discussed and used within the Social Force Model.},

abstract = {Starting with a short review of the available literature in the field of pedestrian and evacuation research, an overview is given over the observed collective phenomena in pedestrian crowds. This includes lane formation in corridors and oscillations at bottlenecks in normal situations, while different kinds of blocked states are produced in panic situations. By means of molecular-dynamic-like microsimulations based on a generalized force model of interactive pedestrian dynamics, the spatio-temporal patterns in pedestrian crowds are successfully reproduced and interpreted as self-organized phenomena. In contrast to previous socio-psychological approaches, this allows a physical understanding of the observations. Despite the significantly different phenomena occuring in normal and panic situations, the main effects can be described by a unified model containing only well interpretable and plausible terms. The transition between the “rational” normal behavior and the apparently “irrational” panic behavior is controlled by a single parameter, the “nervousness”, which influences fluctuation strengths, desired speeds, and the tendency of herding. Thereby, it causes paradoxial effects like “freezing by heating”, “faster is slower”, and the ignorance of available exits. Nevertheless, there are measures to improve pedestrian flows, both in normal and panic situations. For example, the suitable placement of columns can help, although they reduce the accessible space.},
