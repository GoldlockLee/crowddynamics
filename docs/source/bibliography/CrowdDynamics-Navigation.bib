abstract = {In this paper we are concerned with the simulation of crowds in built environments, where obstacles play a role in the dynamics and in the interactions among pedestrians. First of all, we review the state-of-the-art of the techniques for handling obstacles in numerical simulations. Then, we introduce a new modelling technique which guarantees both impermeability and opacity of the obstacles, and does not require ad hoc runtime interventions to avoid collisions. Most important, we solve a complex optimization problem by means of the Particle Swarm Optimization method in order to exploit the so-called Braess's paradox. More precisely, we reduce the evacuation time from a room by adding in the walking area multiple obstacles optimally placed and shaped.},

@article{Dang2014,
abstract = {The fast marching method is widely used to solve the eikonal equation. By introducing a new way of managing propagation interfaces which avoid the use of expensive data structures, the fast iterative method reveals to be a faster variant with a higher parallel potential compared to the fast marching method. We investigate in this paper a multi-level parallel approach for the fast iterative method which is well fitted for today heterogenous and hierarchical architectures. We show experiment results which focus on the fine-grained parallel level of the algorithm and we give a performance analysis. {\textcopyright} The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Kretz2011a,
abstract = {This contribution proposes a method to make agents in a microscopic simulation of pedestrian traffic walk approximately along a path of estimated minimal remaining travel time to their destination. Usually models of pedestrian dynamics are (implicitly) built on the assumption that pedestrians walk along the shortest path. Model elements formulated to make pedestrians locally avoid collisions and intrusion into personal space do not produce motion on quickest paths. Therefore a special model element is needed, if one wants to model and simulate pedestrians for whom travel time matters most (e.g. travelers in a station hall who are late for a train). Here such a model element is proposed, discussed and used within the Social Force Model.},
