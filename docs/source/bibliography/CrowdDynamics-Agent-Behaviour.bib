abstract = {We analyze particle velocity fluctuations in a simulated granular system subjected to homogeneous quasistatic shearing. We show that these fluctuations share the following scaling characteristics of fluid turbulence in spite of their different physical origins: (i) scale-dependent probability distribution with non-Gaussian broadening at small time scales; (ii) spatial power spectrum of the velocity field showing a power-law decay, reflecting long-range correlations and the self-affine nature of the fluctuations; and (iii) superdiffusion of particles with respect to the mean background flow.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a classification of crowd models in built environments based on the assumed pedestrian ability to foresee the movements of other walkers. At the same time, we introduce a new family of macroscopic models, which make it possible to tune the degree of predictiveness (i.e., rationality) of the individuals. By means of these models we describe both the natural behavior of pedestrians, i.e., their expected behavior according to their real limited predictive ability, and a target behavior, i.e., a particularly efficient behavior one would like them to assume (for, e.g., logistic or safety reasons). Then we tackle a challenging shape optimization problem, which consists in controlling the environment in such a way that the natural behavior is as close as possible to the target one, thereby inducing pedestrians to behave more rationally than what they would naturally do. We present numerical tests which elucidate the role of rational/predictive abilities and show some promising results about the shape optimization problem. 1. Introduction. In this paper we are concerned with the modeling of a variety of human behaviors in crowds, characterized by a different degree of pedestrian ability to foresee and anticipate the movements of other walkers. In addition, we investigate the possibility to induce pedestrians to unconsciously behave more rationally than what they would consciously do. Although the research in pedestrian modeling is relatively young, the literature in this field is already large. This is probably due to the fact that many models are inspired by the vehicular traffic literature, which has been deeply investigated for decades. Basically all kinds of models have been proposed so far: Nanoscopic, mi-croscopic, mesoscopic, macroscopic, multiscale, cellular automata, discrete choice, in many variants: First-order, second-order, differential, non-differential, local, nonlocal, with or without contact-avoidance features. A number of reviews are already avail-able, see, e.g., [6, 19]. Concerning books, we mention [29], which develops macroscopic models for the control of pedestrian behavior in connection with the implementation of evacuation strategies, and [17], which investigates extensively the multiscale (micro-scopic+macroscopic) model originally proposed in [15] and presents a detailed review of the literature, including an accurate account of seminal papers. Pedestrians are active particles, namely they are not passively prone to external force fields like inert matter. They observe the surroundings and elaborate a walk-ing strategy while moving. In many cases, they have a specific target and want to reach it either in minimal time or while optimizing some other personal performance criterion. The question is to what extent pedestrians are able to optimize their path and anticipate the movements of the others. Let us describe five possible behaviors in order of increasing degree of predictive ability, say of rationality:},

@article{Colombi2015a,
abstract = {The strategic behavior of pedestrians is largely determined by how they perceive and consequently react to neighboring people. Such interpersonal interactions may be dictated by the emotional state of the individuals, the purpose of their trip, the local crowding, the quality of the environment to mention but a few common examples. This issue is addressed in this paper by a mathematical model which combines, in an evolutionary time- and space-dependent way, discrete and continuous effects of pedestrian interactions. Numerical simulations and qualitative analysis suggest that human perception, and its impact on crowd dynamics, can be effectively modeled as a multiscale process based on such a dual representation of groups of agents.},

@article{Bode2014,
abstract = {The evacuation of crowds from buildings or vehicles is one example that highlights the importance of understanding how individual-level interactions and decision-making combine and lead to the overall behaviour of crowds. In particular, to make evacuations safer, we need to understand how individuals make movement decisions in crowds. Here, we present an evacuation experiment with over 500 participants testing individual behaviour in an interactive virtual environment. Participants had to choose between different exit routes under the influence of three different types of directional information: static information (signs), dynamic information (movement of simulated crowd) and memorized information, as well as the combined effect of these different sources of directional information. In contrast to signs, crowd movement and memorized information did not have a significant effect on human exit route choice in isolation. However, when we combined the latter two treatments with additional directly conflicting sources of directional information, for example signs, they showed a clear effect by reducing the number of participants that followed the opposing directional information. This suggests that the signals participants observe more closely in isolation do not simply overrule alternative sources of directional information. Age and gender did not consistently explain differences in behaviour in our experiments.},

@article{Hoogendoorn2004,
abstract = {Among the most interesting and challenging theoretical and practical problems in describing pedestrians behavior are route choice and activity scheduling. Compared to other modes of transport, a characteristic feature of pedestrian route choice is that routes are continuous trajectories in time and space: since a pedestrian chooses a route from an infinite set of alternatives, dedicated theories and models describing pedestrian route choice are required.This article puts forward a new theory of pedestrian behavior under uncertainty based on the concept of utility maximization. The main behavioral assumption is that pedestrians optimize some predicted pedestrian-specific utility function, representing a trade-off between the utility gained from performing activities at a specific location, and the predicted cost of walking subject to the physical limitations of the pedestrians and the kinematics of the pedestrian. The uncertainty reflects the randomness of the experienced traffic conditions.Based on this normative theory, route choice, activity area choice, and activity scheduling are simultaneously optimized using dynamic programming for different traffic conditions and uncertainty levels. Throughout the article, the concepts are illustrated by examples. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Couzin2005,
abstract = {For animals that forage or travel in groups, making movement decisions often depends on social interactions among group members1,2 . However, in many cases, few individuals have perti- nent information, such as knowledge about the location of a food source3,4 , or of a migration route5–9 . Using a simple model we show how information can be transferred within groups both without signalling and when group members do not know which individuals, if any, have information.We reveal that the larger the group the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group, and that only a very small proportion of informed individuals is required to achieve great accuracy. We also demonstrate how groups can make consensus decisions, even though informed individuals do not know whether they are in a majority or minority, how the quality of their information compareswith that of others, or even whether there are any other informed individuals. Our model provides new insights into the mechanisms of effective leadership and decision-making in biological systems. Primary},
